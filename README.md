### Assignment Details
This assignment is to build a tool that is useful in exploring the concepts of trustworthy computing. 
This assignment also introduces security software and attributes that will be explored further in the second assignment, and acts as a foundation for software development for the third course assignment.

### Task
The Microsoft online documentation has an example illustrating how to program a tool in the article “How To: Run a Partially Trusted Code in a Sandbox”. 
The task is to start with this example and build a tool with an appropriate user interface that permits an executable program to be run with reduced access permissions. 
The tool might be useful in running student course work submissions during assessment. The user interface should allow the user to select a program and choose the relevant permissions. 
As a minimum, the tools should be able to restrict an executing program’s ability to access the file system, to access the network and to access other devices and peripherals. 
A windowed interface will be useful for interactive use of the tool for less experienced users. 
The tool will be tested by executing itself in its sandbox & executing other samples of coursework.
